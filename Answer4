Hi Silas, Michael, and Team,

I hope this email finds you well. Following our internal meeting discussion, I have compiled the probing questions and additional support requests for further clarification on the exceptions noted in the User Access Provisioning testing.

For user "First Name44 Last Name 44":

Is there a job function change since the user has joined the company?
What is the difference between the role assigned in the Intacct system and the userâ€™s role function? Which role has the more privileged access within Intacct?
Do we have the individual IT ticket for the sampled user? Is there a way for us to obtain the full individual IT ticket with notes included?
For user "First Name77 Last Name 77":

Was there another approval obtained prior to system provisioning?
If so, how many days after the system provisioning date is approval obtained?
These questions aim to gather additional details to understand the exceptions better and ensure a comprehensive analysis. Additionally, it would be beneficial to obtain the individual IT ticket with notes for both cases.

Please feel free to add any further questions or comments. Once I receive your approval, I will promptly draft the formal email to our client, cc'ing you, Michael, for your review.

Thank you for your guidance and support.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
