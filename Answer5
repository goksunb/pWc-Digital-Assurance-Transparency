Subject: User Access Provisioning Testing Results - Deficiency Analysis

Hi Michael,

I hope this email finds you well. I've completed the deficiency analysis based on the client's responses. Here's a breakdown:

User "First Name44 Last Name44":

IT Ticket: Attached is the associated IT ticket. The user's job function was corrected to "Sr. Software Engineer" and is appropriately provisioned in Intacct.
Job Function Change: No, there has been no change in the user's job function.
Role Differences: "Outsourced Labor" and "Sr. Software Engineer" roles are different. "Sr. Software Engineer" holds more privileged access within Intacct.
Analysis: This case is a false positive deficiency. The user was correctly provisioned, and the initial IT ticket was amended for accuracy.

User "First Name77 Last Name77":

IT Ticket: Attached is the associated IT ticket.
Reason for Provisioning Before Approval: Management oversight. Agreed as a deficiency.
User Log: The user did not log in to Intacct between the key dates.
Analysis: This case is a confirmed deficiency. There is no risk impact due to the user not logging in during the non-approved period.

Next Steps:

Include the details and background provided by the client in our workpaper.
For "First Name77 Last Name77," inform the client of the positive deficiency, and mention the increased sample size in the next testing phase.
Assess compensating controls, specifically the Quarterly Access Review and System Access Control, and include their descriptions in the final result delivery.
I will ensure these points are covered in the final presentation to the client. Let me know if there are any additional aspects you'd like me to address.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
