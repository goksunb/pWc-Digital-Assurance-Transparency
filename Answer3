Hello Michael,

I hope this email finds you well. I have completed the preliminary testing for the User Access Provisioning and Modification control. Below is a summary of the testing results:

Sample Item 1: New User Access Provisioning

Testing Details:

Reviewed the email approval from the manager for a new user access request.
Validated that the system administrator documented the approval and provisioned the user with the appropriate access level.
Confirmed the system-generated email was sent to the new user.
Testing Conclusion:

The control is effective for new user access provisioning. No exceptions were identified.
Sample Item 2: User Access Modification

Testing Details:

Examined a user-initiated ticket for access modification.
Verified the system administrator's validation of proper approval before making changes.
Checked that the ticket was appropriately documented and closed after the modification.
Testing Conclusion:

The control for user access modification is effective. No exceptions were found.
Additional Notes:

The organization uses Jira as the ticketing system for tracking and managing access requests, and it was consistently applied during the testing.
The documentation for both provisioning and modification processes was thorough.
Next Steps:

I will continue with the remaining sample testing items and provide a comprehensive report on the control's effectiveness.
If any exceptions are identified in subsequent testing, I will request additional information from the client and analyze the implications for further discussion.
Please let me know if you require any additional information or if there are specific aspects you would like me to focus on during the remaining testing.

Thank you for your guidance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
